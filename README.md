# CSCI-232-DataStructues
Fall 2019

## Overview

CSCI 232, Data Structures and Algorithms. This course explored and implemented different algorithms, for sorting as well as traversing graphs and trees.


## Program 1

Program 1 contains my own from scratch implementations of Bubble Sort, Cocktail Sort, and Radix Sort, as well as a short write up containing their runtimes and advantages.
Output.png shows the program running. 
Stopwatch.Java was provided, and is used to track runtime.

## Program 2

Program 2 uses a dataset of all the computer science classes offered a Montana State in 2019, complete with all of the information about them. 
A provided Skeleton of a Binary Search tree and Queue were given, which I implemented Breadth First and Depth First search, as well as modified some logic to make it more robust.
MSUClass.java is an object that stores all of the information for each class.
The main program traverses the tree using both breadth first and depth first search.

## Program 3

Program 3 uses the same dataset as program 2, except uses a graph instead of a BST. See the main program for more info.
